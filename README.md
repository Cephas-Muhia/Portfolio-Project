# Lost & Found App

## Introduction
The Lost & Found App is a centralized platform designed to help users report and find lost items with ease. Whether it's your favorite watch, a cherished piece of jewelry, or an essential document, this app aims to make the recovery process less stressful and more efficient. This project was developed as part of a portfolio project for Holberton School.
